TODO(crbug.com/406226): Remove this directory once ARC is rebased to L.

This directory contains newer Bionic sources from AOSP master.
We partially use modified version of them, and these modified files track
files in this directory.

- libc/include/locale.h
- libc/include/xlocale.h

They are from AOSP Bionic (https://android.googlesource.com/platform/bionic),
and the revision is 001815ed197280409d08e9622890e7462c6e6831
