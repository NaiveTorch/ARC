# This file sets up default exclusions for special cases of source code that
# would fail the various lint style checks used by lint_source.py
# This file complies with JSON with an exception that allows comments to be
# written, which begin with # character and last until the end of the line.
#
# This is a quick example of what each line should look like:
#
#   # Exclude src/xyzzy.cpp from the checks "gnusto" and "rezrov"
#   "src/xyzzy.cpp": ["gnusto", "rezrov"],
