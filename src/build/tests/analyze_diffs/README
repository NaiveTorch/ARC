Add files in this directory to create new tests for analyze_diffs.

  mods/foo.cpp - ARC modified file.
  mods/foo.cpp.fail - indicates mods/foo.cpp will fail the analyze_diffs
     run and its output is the expected output.  The output can be generated by
       $ src/build/analyze_diffs.py \
           src/build/tests/analyze_diffs/mods/file.txt
     If this file exists, the .success file should not.
  mods/foo.cpp.success - indicates that mods/foo.cpp will succeed the
     analyze_diffs check.  Its contents are ignored - successful runs
     are always tested to produce no output.  If this file exists,
     the .fail file should not.
  third_party/foo.cpp - default upstream file.

The test will be triggered by ninja.
